            <h4>Patient Care Goals</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Promptly recognize cardiac arrest in infants and children: unresponsiveness, abnormal or absent breathing, absence of a pulse or inadequate perfusion.</li>
                <li>Provide immediate, high‑quality chest compressions and effective ventilations with minimal interruptions.</li>
                <li>Use defibrillation promptly when indicated (shockable rhythms).</li>
                <li>Maintain normoxia and avoid hyperventilation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Inclusion Criteria</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Infants and children ≤13 years found unresponsive, not breathing normally, and/or pulseless.</li>
                <li>Infants and children with inadequate circulation requiring BLS interventions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Exclusion Criteria</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Obvious signs of irreversible death (rigor mortis, dependent lividity, decapitation).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Assessment Points</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scene safety & initial impression:</strong> Confirm scene safety. Assess responsiveness using tactile and verbal stimuli. Use the Pediatric Assessment Triangle (PAT): Appearance, Work of Breathing, Circulation to Skin.</li>
                <li><strong>Breathing assessment:</strong> Check for normal breathing (no more than 10 seconds). Gasping is not normal breathing.</li>
                <li><strong>Circulation:</strong> Check central pulse (carotid in children >1 year, brachial in infants <1 year) within 10 seconds. If no pulse or HR <60 bpm with poor perfusion despite oxygenation and ventilation, begin chest compressions.</li>
                <li><strong>Triage category:</strong> All unconscious patients and patients in cardiac arrest are Red Priority.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Management & Interventions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Check responsiveness</strong> – tap and shout.</li>
                <li><strong>Request ALS back‑up</strong> – specify "pediatric cardiac arrest" and confirm ETA.</li>
                <li><strong>Retrieve emergency equipment</strong> – first rescuer stays with patient, second retrieves AED and emergency equipment.</li>
                <li><strong>Primary survey (C‑A‑B):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Circulation:</strong> Start chest compressions immediately if no pulse felt within 10 seconds.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Depth: at least 1/3 anterior‑posterior chest diameter (~4 cm in infants, ~5 cm in children).</li>
                                <li>Rate: 100‑120/min.</li>
                                <li>Allow full chest recoil.</li>
                                <li>Minimise interruptions (<10 seconds).</li>
                                <li>Compression:ventilation ratio: single rescuer 30:2; two or more rescuers 15:2.</li>
                                <li>Rotate compressors every 2 minutes if possible.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Airway:</strong> Open airway (head‑tilt/chin‑lift if no trauma; jaw‑thrust if trauma suspected). Use OPA/NPA when available. Supraglottic airways (laryngeal tubes) should be routinely placed when available.</li>
                        <li><strong>Breathing:</strong> Provide 2 effective breaths after every set of compressions. Use BVM with 100% oxygen as soon as available. Target SpO₂ ≥94% (avoid hyperoxia). Maintain EtCO₂ 35‑45 mmHg if monitored. Consider advanced airway management if supraglottic airway provides inadequate ventilation or there is excessive secretion/vomit.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Defibrillation:</strong> Attach AED or manual defibrillator as soon as available. Use pediatric pads if available; otherwise use adult pads. For shockable rhythms (VF/pVT):
                    <ul>
                        <li>First shock: 2 J/kg.</li>
                        <li>Subsequent shocks: 4 J/kg, up to max 10 J/kg (not exceeding adult dose).</li>
                        <li>Resume CPR immediately after shock.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>IV/IO access:</strong> Obtain IV access; if not readily available or may be delayed, consider IO access.</li>
                <li><strong>Medications:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Epinephrine (adrenaline): 0.01 mg/kg (1:10,000) IV/IO every 3‑5 minutes. If no IV/IO access, via ETT at 0.03 mg/kg.</li>
                        <li>Amiodarone (refractory VF/pVT): 5 mg/kg IV/IO after 3rd shock; repeat 5 mg/kg after 5th shock.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Check blood glucose</strong> – treat hypoglycaemia if present (Hypoglycaemia CPG).</li>
                <li><strong>Consider reversible causes (4 Hs & 4 Ts):</strong> Hypoxia, hypovolemia, hypothermia, hypo/hyperkalemia, tension pneumothorax, tamponade, toxins, thrombosis.</li>
                <li><strong>Reassess for ROSC</strong> – check pulse every 2 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Transfer:</strong> All pediatric cardiac arrest patients must be transported to hospital. See Starting, Stopping or Transferring CPR CPG for guidance on transferring under CPR.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Special Considerations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Defibrillation with Lifepak 15:</strong> Pediatric pads in AED mode do not adjust joules appropriately – use manual mode and select appropriate Joules (2 J/kg then 4 J/kg).</li>
                <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> Always use appropriate‑sized equipment; Broselow tape is recommended to quickly estimate weight and select correct equipment sizes and medication doses.</li>
                <li><strong>Team coordination:</strong> Communicate clearly and assign roles during resuscitation.</li>
                <li><strong>If ALS back‑up is delayed:</strong> Maintain effective CPR and consider transport if hospital is closer.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Safety Considerations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid over‑ventilation or excessive oxygenation.</li>
                <li>Use correct compression depth and rate.</li>
                <li>Defibrillate promptly if indicated; avoid delays.</li>
                <li>Rotate compressors to prevent fatigue.</li>
                <li>Protect airway and cervical spine if trauma suspected.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Documentation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Identification: name, age, sex, estimated weight.</li>
                <li>Medical complaint: pediatric cardiac arrest – specify if witnessed/unwitnessed.</li>

                <li>Signs: initial and ongoing HR, rhythm, SpO₂, EtCO₂, skin color, responsiveness.</li>
                <li>Treatment: CPR start time, quality (rate/depth), defibrillation (number, energy), airway interventions, oxygen, glucose, medications.</li>
