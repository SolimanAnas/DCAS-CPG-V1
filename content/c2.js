Intervene only if the cough becomes ineffective, or the patient shows signs of severe obstruction (silent cough, cyanosis, inability to speak)." },
                { q: "For a conscious adult with severe FBAO (ineffective cough, unable to speak), what is the recommended sequence of interventions?", options: ["5 abdominal thrusts, then 5 back blows", "5 back blows, then 5 chest thrusts", "Start CPR immediately", "5 chest thrusts, then 5 back blows"], correct: 1, explanation: "The Heimlich manoeuvre (abdominal thrusts) is no longer recommended due to risk of internal injury. DCAS protocols advise: up to 5 back blows (between the shoulder blades), then up to 5 chest thrusts (similar to chest compressions but sharper and slower). Repeat cycles until the object is expelled or the patient becomes unconscious." },

Before giving rescue breaths, open the mouth and look for a visible object. If seen, remove it with a finger sweep – but do not perform blind sweeps." },
                { q: "What is the maximum number of attempts allowed for removing a foreign body under direct laryngoscopy (using Magill forceps) in the prehospital setting?", options: ["1 attempt", "2 attempts", "3 attempts", "Unlimited attempts if oxygen saturations remain above 90%"], correct: 1, explanation: "A maximum of 2 attempts at removal under direct laryngoscopy is permitted. If unsuccessful, revert to basic airway management (BVM, supraglottic airway) and transport urgently." },
                { q: "Which patient populations are at higher risk for FBAO?", options: ["Young children only", "Older adults only", "People with intellectual disabilities only", "All of the above"], correct: 3, explanation: "All these groups are at increased risk: young children (exploring by mouth), older adults (dental issues, swallowing disorders), and individuals with intellectual disabilities or neurological impairment (poor coordination of swallowing)." },
                { q: "For a suspected esophageal foreign body (no airway compromise, patient can speak and breathe), what is an appropriate prehospital action?", options: ["Perform immediate laryngoscopy", "Offer small amounts of liquid to assist passage", "Apply abdominal thrusts", "Insert a nasopharyngeal airway"], correct: 1, explanation: "If the object is likely in the oesophagus (not causing airway obstruction), small sips of liquid may help it pass. However, if the object is hazardous (e.g., button battery, sharp object) or the patient cannot swallow, transport urgently without delay." },
                { q: "What is the hallmark sign of severe airway obstruction?", options: ["Audible wheezing", "Stridor (high‑pitched inspiratory sound)", "Productive cough", "Hoarseness"], correct: 1, explanation: "Stridor indicates upper airway narrowing and is a sign of severe obstruction. Complete obstruction may present with a silent chest and no audible breath sounds." },
                { q: "In a child who has ingested a button battery, what is the correct prehospital action?", options: ["Observe at home for symptoms", "Induce vomiting", "Transport urgently to hospital", "Give milk to drink"], correct: 2, explanation: "Button batteries are hazardous – they can cause severe caustic injury and necrosis within hours. Do not induce vomiting (may cause re‑impaction or aspiration). Transport immediately to a facility with surgical capability." },
                { q: "When should ALS back‑up be requested for a patient with FBAO?", options: ["All cases of choking, regardless of severity", "Only if the patient becomes unconscious", "If severe obstruction is present or basic measures fail to clear the airway", "Never; BLS management is sufficient"], correct: 2, explanation: "ALS back‑up is indicated for severe obstruction (ineffective cough, stridor, cyanosis) or if basic interventions (back blows, chest thrusts) do not relieve the obstruction. Early ALS can provide advanced airway management if needed." },
                { q: "What is the correct technique for chest thrusts in a conscious choking adult?", options: ["Thrusts in the centre of the chest, similar to chest compressions", "Thrusts on the upper abdomen, just below the xiphoid process", "Thrusts on the lower sternum, angled upward", "Thrusts on the back, between the shoulder blades"], correct: 0, explanation: "Chest thrusts are performed in the same location as chest compressions (centre of the chest, lower half of the sternum). They generate airway pressure and can dislodge the object. Abdominal thrusts are avoided due to risk of injury." }

Rapid ventilation leads to breath‑stacking (air trapping) and auto‑PEEP, which can cause hypotension and barotrauma. Allow enough time for exhalation – a rate of 6–8 breaths/min is often appropriate." },

Target SpO₂ is 88–92% to maintain adequate oxygenation while avoiding CO₂ narcosis." },
                { q: "Which non‑invasive ventilation mode is preferred for a COPD patient with hypercapnic respiratory failure?", options: ["CPAP", "BiPAP", "High‑flow nasal cannula", "Bag‑valve‑mask"], correct: 1, explanation: "BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure) provides both inspiratory support (IPAP) to help unload respiratory muscles and expiratory pressure (EPAP) to keep airways open. It is more effective than CPAP for hypercapnia." },
                { q: "A 70‑year‑old COPD patient on high‑flow oxygen becomes drowsy and confused. What is the most likely cause?", options: ["Stroke", "Hypoglycaemia", "CO₂ narcosis", "Myocardial infarction"], correct: 2, explanation: "Excessive oxygen in COPD can reduce the hypoxic drive, leading to hypoventilation and rising CO₂ levels (hypercapnia). This causes drowsiness, confusion, and eventually respiratory depression." },
                { q: "What is the initial dose of nebulised salbutamol for an adult with COPD exacerbation?", options: ["2.5 mg", "5 mg", "10 mg", "1.25 mg"], correct: 1, explanation: "The standard adult dose is 5 mg nebulised salbutamol. It can be repeated as needed." },
                { q: "Ipratropium bromide is best described as:", options: ["A beta‑2 agonist", "An anticholinergic bronchodilator", "A corticosteroid", "A mucolytic"], correct: 1, explanation: "Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic that blocks muscarinic receptors in the airways, leading to bronchodilation and reduced secretions." },
                { q: "What is a classic sign of CO₂ retention in a COPD patient?", options: ["Bounding pulse", "Tachycardia", "Hypertension", "Crackles on auscultation"], correct: 0, explanation: "Hypercapnia causes peripheral vasodilation, leading to warm extremities and a bounding pulse. Other signs include drowsiness, confusion, and tremors." },

What is the next appropriate step?", options: ["Repeat nebulisers again", "Start BiPAP", "Intubate immediately", "Give IV adrenaline"], correct: 1, explanation: "BiPAP is indicated for moderate‑severe distress not responding to initial therapy. It can prevent the need for intubation. Intubation is reserved for failure of NIV or contraindications." },
                { q: "Which of the following is an absolute contraindication to BiPAP?", options: ["SpO₂ 90% on oxygen", "Respiratory rate 32", "GCS 12", "Unable to protect airway (GCS <8)"], correct: 3, explanation: "BiPAP requires a conscious patient who can protect their airway. A GCS <8 (or any inability to maintain airway) is an absolute contraindication – these patients need intubation." },
                { q: "What does a 'shark fin' capnography waveform indicate?", options: ["Normal breathing", "Bronchospasm (obstructive pattern)", "Pneumothorax", "Apnoea"], correct: 1, explanation: "A 'shark fin' (or sloping) waveform indicates prolonged expiratory phase due to lower airway obstruction, as seen in asthma and COPD." },
                { q: "In a COPD patient, why is it important to use medical air to drive nebulisers if available?", options: ["It is cheaper", "To avoid delivering excessive oxygen during prolonged nebulisation", "It improves drug deposition", "It causes less irritation"], correct: 1, explanation: "Prolonged nebulisation with oxygen can deliver high FiO₂, risking hypercapnia. Using medical air (or limiting oxygen to 2–4 L/min via nasal cannula during nebulisation) helps maintain target SpO₂ 88–92%." }
