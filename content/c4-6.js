            <h4>Patient Care Goals</h4>

                <li>Provide routine care to the newborn infant.</li>
                <li>Rapidly identify newborns requiring resuscitative efforts.</li>
                <li>Establish spontaneous breathing and a stable heart rate.</li>
                <li>Maintain normothermia and adequate oxygenation while avoiding complications.</li>
                <li>Deliver high‑quality chest compressions/CPR with minimal interruptions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Inclusion Criteria</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Newborns (< 4 weeks) and preterm infants requiring resuscitation due to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Apnoea or gasping respiration.</li>
                        <li>Heart rate < 100 bpm at 1 minute post‑delivery.</li>
                        <li>Cyanosis or pale appearance.</li>
                        <li>Poor muscle tone or lack of crying.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Exclusion Criteria</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Infants > 4 weeks of age (see Pediatric Resuscitation CPG).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Assessment Points</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Patient history:</strong> Date/time of birth, prenatal history (substance abuse, multiple gestation, maternal illness), birth history (maternal fever, meconium, maternal bleeding, difficult delivery, prolapsed cord, nuchal cord, breech), estimated gestational age.</li>
                <li><strong>Physical examination:</strong> Respiratory rate and effort (strong, weak, regular, irregular); signs of distress (grunting, flaring, retractions, gasping); heart rate (fast, slow, absent – auscultation preferred); muscle tone; colour/appearance (cyanosis, pallor).</li>
                <li><strong>APGAR score:</strong> At 1 and 5 minutes post‑delivery (Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration).</li>
                <li><strong>Triage category:</strong> All patients requiring ventilatory support or chest compressions are Red Priority (even if improved).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Management & Interventions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Immediately after delivery:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Assess tone, breathing/crying. If adequate, no resuscitation needed → go to Childbirth CPG.</li>
                        <li>If weak cry, distress, poor tone, or preterm: position airway (sniffing), clear airway (suction mouth then nose if obstruction; routine suction not recommended), dry, warm, stimulate. Wrap in dry towel/plastic bag, cover head.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Reassess breathing and heart rate:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Laboured breathing/persistent cyanosis:</strong> Attach SpO₂ monitor, consider supplementary O₂ (start low FiO₂).</li>
                        <li><strong>Apnoea/gasping:</strong> Position airway, consider adjuncts (OPA/NPA/intubation), assist ventilation (PPV) at 40‑60 bpm with room air initially. Attach ECG monitor.</li>
                        <li><strong>Consider cord clamping:</strong> If no rapid improvement or immediate resuscitation needed, clamp cord in three places (10, 15, 20 cm) and cut between clamps furthest from newborn.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>If HR < 100 bpm:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Initiate BVM ventilation with room air at 40‑60 breaths/min for 90 seconds. Primary indicator of effectiveness is improvement in heart rate.</li>
                        <li>If no improvement after 90 seconds, change to 100% O₂ until heart rate normalises.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>If HR < 60 bpm:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Initiate chest compressions (two‑thumb encircling hands technique preferred).</li>
                        <li>Compression:ventilation ratio 3:1 (90 compressions, 30 ventilations per minute).</li>
                        <li>Consider endotracheal intubation or supraglottic airway.</li>
                        <li>Establish IV/IO access.</li>
                        <li>Administer epinephrine (adrenaline) 0.01 mg/kg IV/IO every 3‑5 minutes if HR remains <60 bpm.</li>
                        <li>If signs of shock or post‑resuscitation, give 20 mL/kg normal saline IV/IO.</li>
                        <li>Check blood glucose.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Safety Considerations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Hypothermia is common and worsens outcomes – dry, warm, cover head, use kangaroo care if stable.</li>
                <li>Preterm infants <23 weeks may receive comfort care based on parental wishes; resuscitation not routinely recommended.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Clinical Insights & Additional Guidance</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Most newborns need only drying, warming, and stimulation.</li>
                <li>Resuscitation sequence: Dry, Warm, Stimulate – Ventilate – Evaluate – Resuscitate.</li>
                <li>If placenta delivered, place in biohazard bag and transport with patient.</li>
                <li>Pulse oximetry on right hand best; target 60‑65% at 1 minute, rising 5%/min to 85‑90% at 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Both hypoxia and excess oxygen harmful – titrate to 85‑95%.</li>
                <li>Increase in heart rate is the most reliable indicator of effective resuscitation.</li>
                <li>Acrocyanosis (blue extremities) normal; distinguish from central cyanosis.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Documentation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Identification: gender, estimated gestational age, time of birth.</li>
                <li>Mechanism/medical complaint: symptoms (apnoea, gasping, poor tone, cyanosis).</li>
                <li>Injuries/information: prenatal/birth history, maternal medications.</li>
                <li>Signs: vital signs, APGAR at 1 and 5 minutes, physical findings, blood glucose.</li>
                <li>Treatment: airway management, warming, stimulation, ventilations, chest compressions, medications, cord management, oxygen therapy.</li>
                <li>Allergies: not typically applicable.</li>
                <li>Medications: any given.</li>

            </ul>

                <li>Provide chest compressions and ventilation within 30 seconds of HR <60 bpm.</li>
